# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer
First you need to import createContext and export you variable that equals to createContext. Then you import it into your provider which stores the initial data of your context and hold it in contextValues. Finally you return your context.provider with the values and wrap your App with your provider.
